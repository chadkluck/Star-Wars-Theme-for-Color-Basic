# Star-Wars-Theme-for-Color-Basic
Color Basic code (ran on vintage 1986 computers such as the Tandy Color Computer 2) that will play the Star Wars theme

The code can be used as an educational example of how compression works. For example, many note sequences are repeated in the song so instead of coding out all the notes, the repeated sequences were identified by the programmer, stored in a reference variable, and those reference variables are then called to play the song. This is similar to how a very basic compression algorithm works.
